# PwnDock

This is my slightly customized version of
[pwndock](https://github.com/Grazfather/pwndock). That image is pushed to
docker cloud so this can build rather quickly.

## Installation
1. Install Docker: `brew cask install docker` on OSX. You can figure it out on Linux.
2. Build: `./build`

## Running it
Management: `start`, `stop`, `connect`
